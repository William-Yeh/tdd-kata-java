# Project Context

## Overview
This is a Test-Driven Development (TDD) kata project written in Java using Maven as the build tool. The project follows standard Maven directory structure with source code in `src/main/java` and tests in `src/test/java`.

## Project Structure
- **src/main/java/com/kata/Foo.java**: Main implementation class
- **src/test/java/com/kata/FooTest.java**: Test class for Foo
- **pom.xml**: Maven project configuration
- **memory-bank/**: Directory containing project memory and context files
  - **projectContext.md**: This file - contains project overview and context
  - **codeIndex.md**: Index of code components and their purposes
  - **todo.md**: Current tasks and progress tracking

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: Java
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Testing Framework**: JUnit 5
- **Assertion Library**: Hamcrest

## Current State
- Basic project structure is set up
- Foo.java and FooTest.java exist but may be minimal implementations
- Memory-bank mechanism is being initialized

## Goals
- Practice TDD principles
- Implement features through red-green-refactor cycle
- Maintain project context and progress tracking through memory-bank
