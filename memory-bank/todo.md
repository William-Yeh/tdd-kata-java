# Project TODO

## Memory-Bank Setup
- [x] Initialize memory-bank directory structure
- [x] Create projectContext.md with project overview
- [x] Create codeIndex.md with code documentation
- [x] Create todo.md for task tracking

## TDD Kata Progress
- [x] Set up basic Foo class with sayHello method
- [x] Create corresponding unit test for sayHello
- [x] Verify test passes with current implementation
- [x] Migrate from Hamcrest to AssertJ assertion library

## Next Steps
- [ ] Identify next feature to implement (e.g., parameterized greeting, multiple methods)
- [ ] Write failing test for new feature (Red phase)
- [ ] Implement minimal code to make test pass (Green phase)
- [ ] Refactor code while maintaining test coverage (Refactor phase)
- [ ] Update memory-bank files with new changes

## Potential Features to Explore
- [ ] Add method to greet with custom name
- [ ] Add method to greet multiple people
- [ ] Add method to handle different languages
- [ ] Add method to handle time-based greetings (morning/afternoon/evening)

## Maintenance
- [ ] Keep memory-bank files updated with code changes
- [ ] Ensure all new code has corresponding tests
- [ ] Review and refactor code as needed
